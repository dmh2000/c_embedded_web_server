This is a simple webserver I wrote in 1995 for presentation at the Embedded Systems Conference in 1996. **This was the first presentation at the ESC about using a web server to provide the user interface for an embedded system**. This web server was demo'ed in the vendor booths at National Semiconductor and Ready Systems. 

This was written on a Windows 95 machine using Microsoft C (not visual C yet). That's why the filenames are all caps. The demos at ESC were hosted on Ready Systems VRTX operating system running on a Nat Semi x86 processor. 

I have used various versions of this code on embedded systems over the years. There are better alternatives now but it has served well.

I upload this to Github so i wouldn't lose the code and as an example of code I wrote back in the day.

Most of the code is portable C. The OS specific parts are in the directories W95 (windows port) and VXW (vxworks port).

I owe my brother Jim Howard for telling me (in 1994) about this new 'World Wide Web' thing and spurring me to follow up with this project among others.
