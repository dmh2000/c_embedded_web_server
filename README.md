This is a simple webserver I wrote in 1995 for presentation at the Embedded Systems Conference in 1996. This was the first presentation at the ESC about using a web server to provide the user interface for an embedded systems. This web server was used in the vendor booths at National Semiconductor and Ready System. 

This was written on a DOS 3.1 machine using Microsoft C (not visual C yet). That's why the filenames are all caps. The demos at ESC were hosted on Ready Systems VRTX operating system running on a Nat Semi x86 processor. 

I have used various versions of this code on embedded systems over the years. There are probably better alternatives now but it has served well.

I upload this to Github so i wouldn't lose the code and as an example of code I wrote back in the day.
